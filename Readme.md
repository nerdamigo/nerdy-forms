#Nerdy Forms

Nerdy forms is designed to be a quick, easy way to handle the plumbing between the forms we drop on client facing websites. It is best suited to tasks where you'd like a way to simply begin gathering information from your users, perhaps as a stopgap on the way to a more formalized model and controller; though it is certainly capable of being the destination.

To see some examples of it in action, check out the [live demo application][1].

#### Feedback and Ideas

Don't be shy! I'd love to hear your thoughts, ideas, criticisms and musings. The issues section of github is a good place to submit concerns, and for other discussion, check out the comments section on each of the examples or the contact page of the [live demo][1]
